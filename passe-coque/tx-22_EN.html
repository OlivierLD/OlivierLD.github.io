        Departing from Les Sables d'Olonnes in this year's Vendée Globe, Jolly-Jumper introduces navigation to 
        several supportive and responsible associations
        since the start of his renaissance with Water Family. <a href="https://waterfamily.org/" target="WF">https://waterfamily.org/</a>.<br/>
        In 2023, discovery days for young autistic people were organized with the <a href="https://2022.vendeecoeur.fr/" targe="VC">Vendée C&oelig;ur</a> association.<br/>
        IN 2024 these operations will be renewed and the Régates Choletaises association (HANDIVOILE FFV club) 
        which allows disabled people to sail in light sails thanks to specific equipment will use Jolly-Jumper to extend its activity towards habitable sailing.
