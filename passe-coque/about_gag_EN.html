    Gabrielle (pronounced "Gab") and Guy.<br/>
    The human and environmental dimension is the backbone of a life journey engaged in ecological, 
    social and societal transitions.<br/>
    A long career of around twenty years as executives in the industry led them to entrepreneurship in 2014, 
    thus allowing them to act in a freer, more committed, more involved way. Today, within a committed Breton territory, 
    they are carrying out a project on a sailing catamaran with a view to inclusion, reconnection to living things, 
    sobriety, observation of the ocean-climate-biodiversity relationship. 
    Within an ecosystem of committed humans, the activities will combine coastal cruises, unusual habitats, unusual restaurants, training.
