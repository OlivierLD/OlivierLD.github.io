        <h2>Gabrielle et Guy, Boat Club Development</h2>
        Gabrielle (pronounced "Gab") and Guy.<br/>
        The human and environmental dimension is the backbone of a life journey engaged in ecological, 
        social and societal transitions.<br/>
        A long career of around twenty years as executives in the industry led them to entrepreneurship in 2014, 
        thus allowing them to act in a freer, more committed, more involved way. Today, within a committed Breton territory, 
        they are carrying out a project on a sailing catamaran with a view to inclusion, reconnection to living things, 
        sobriety, observation of the ocean-climate-biodiversity relationship. 
        Within an ecosystem of committed humans, the activities will combine coastal cruises, unusual habitats, unusual restaurants, training.
