        Greta is a national education structure which provides training for adults using the structures of vocational high schools. 
        Some high school teachers work overtime in this structure but others belong to Greta; this is the case of Benjamin Rasseneur, 
        our referent for the Kelt.<br/>
        The module that concerns us includes outboard and in board engine repairs, onboard electricity, plastics processing and boat maintenance.<br/>
        During training over a school year, trainees pass the coastal license.<br/>
        Last year, the return to service of the Kelt "ar mor vran" consisted of strengthening the starboard side by plasticizing the 
        interior and an omega, checking the rigging and repairing the engine...<br/>
        In this case my role was to approach the principal to have access to the training and we will have to start again because he was 
        replaced this year.<br/>
        Currently deck hatches are being manufactured for us.
