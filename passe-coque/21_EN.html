<h2>Welcome to our Association!</h2>
The Passe-Coque association, created in 2019 in
the Morbihan department, sticks to the simple idea<br/>
of saving and refitting abandonned or slated-for-demolition
boats, to then transmit them 
to associations, sailing schools or NGOs<br/>
where they'll facilitate access to sailing
for a great number of people, usefully navigating through ecological, social, humanitarian and united projects.<br/>
