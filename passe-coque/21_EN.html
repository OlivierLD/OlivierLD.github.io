<h2>Welcome to our Association!</h2>
The Passe-Coque association, born in 2019 in<br/>
the Morbihan department, sticks to the simple idea<br/>
of saving and refitting abandonned or slated-for-demolition<br/>
boats, to then transmit them<br/>
to associations, sailing schools or NGOs<br/>
where they'll facilitate access to sailing<br/>
for a reat number of people, usefully navigating through ecological, social, humanitarian and united projects.<br/>
