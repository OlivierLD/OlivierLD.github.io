    The Passe-Coque association, created in 2019 in
    the Morbihan department, sticks to the simple idea<br/>
    of saving and refitting abandonned or slated-for-demolition
    boats, to then transmit them 
    to associations, sailing schools or NGOs<br/>
    where they'll facilitate access to sailing
    for a great number of people, usefully navigating through ecological, social, humanitarian and united projects.<br/>
