        F&Eacute;LICIE was first of all the first offshore school of "passeurs d'&eacute;coutes".
        The admiral sailboat F&eacute;LICIE was bequeathed to us in May 2021 and Jean Philippe Baron was the first referent.
        F&eacute;licie sailed offshore to train future sailors who respect the sea to become project leaders.
        This is how Floriane or Colin and Aur&eacute;lie were able to set up their own adventure after being on board F&eacute;licie.<br/>
        <h2>Fall 2021 :</h2>
        F&eacute;licie was the subject of a major refit project in Saint Malo.<br/>
        In January 2022, at the hands of the Afri'Can association and its president and new referent Laurent Cauchy F&eacute;licie crossed the Atlantic 
        and returned to bring prostheses in partnership with Nav Solidaire.<br/>
        <h2>2022 / 2023</h2>
        F&eacute;licie focused on Afri'can missions and is now based in Dakar.<br/>
        It will become the property of the Afri'can association in January 2024 but remains monitored by Passe&#8209;Coque to help with the humanitarian 
        missions that Afri'can has set up.<br/>
