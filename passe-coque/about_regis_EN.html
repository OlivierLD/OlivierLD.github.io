        Golden hands and who knows how to transmit.<br/>
        A teacher in the technical field, Régis even built his own boat, a 40-foot catamaran. 
        He now makes this experience available to Passe&#8209;Coque to disseminate this know-how.

        "The catamaran was made of cold molded wood and I sailed for a few years in the Mediterranean 
        before taking it up to Paris via Gibraltar alone with my 4 children.<br/>
        I also had the chance to participate in the construction and testing of the "coco jet" trimaran 
        designed and built by Patrick Vandame and Antoine Dequidt."
