            Philippe Benoiton explains his participation in Cap-Martinique:<br/>
            “A dream is not meant to stay in drawers. My dream is as old as anything and I would like to realize it now: 
            to cross the Atlantic alone by sail, in one go from La Trinit&eacute;-sur-Mer to Martinique. 
            If I come to want this achievement today, it is because I feel capable of taking part in it.”
        </p>

            Benoiton is not a name unknown to sailors because his brother Patrick worked for the magazines “Bateaux” 
            and “Loisirs Nautiques” and wrote numerous works dedicated to the sea.
