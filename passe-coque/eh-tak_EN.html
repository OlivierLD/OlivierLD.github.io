                <div>
                    Built in nearly 1000 units in the 1970s, this family keelboat was designed by Swedish architect Olle Enderlein. 
                    With a draft of 1.55m and a beam of only 2.60m, this small family cruising sailboat is an ideal partner for cruising along the coast. 
                    It is equipped with 4 to 5 beds: 2 people in the front cabin, 1 person in the rear bunk and 1 to 2 people can sleep in the saloon where the sliding 
                    dining table gives way to a final berth. 
                    The boat is equipped with toilets and a two-burner gas stove. A fridge container (not powered) but cleverly placed at the bottom of the hold keeps food cool.

                <h2>Son histoire</h2>
                <div>
                    Named Eh'Tak in tribute to the name given to the astral cartography used by the Polynesian peoples, this charming sailboat with its inimitable 
                    Nordic style has already had many lives. Its last owner, Werner Hesslauer - a doctor of Swiss-German origin, carried out major salvage 
                    work to put it back on its feet (the boat having been abandoned).
                    Werner had to reluctantly part with the boat for family reasons with the wish that the boat continues to sail usefully with associations.
                </div>
                <h2>Associative projects</h2>
                <div>
                    The boat is currently being refitted to accommodate a new gas stove and a gas connection (replacing a kerosene stove, considered too dangerous).
                    The boat will join the Passe&#8209;Coque Club from 2024 in order to bring the joys of coastal cruising to as many people as possible.
