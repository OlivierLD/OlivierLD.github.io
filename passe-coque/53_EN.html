        The entire <b>Passe&#8209;Coque ecosystem</b> is mobilized to carry out its most ambitious project: bringing 
        together in a <b>single place</b> the values, know-how and actions of our association in the service of a <b>blue economy of transition</b>.<br/>
        Several projects are currently under study in the Morbihan department and we hope to "drop our bags" during the year 2024 or 2025.<br/>
        This project is part of a <b>cooperative approach</b> to responding to social, societal and economic challenges in our region. 
        We have therefore opted for a legal structure called <b>SCIC: Collective Interest Cooperative Society</b>.<br/>
        Once the location has been designated, we will launch a <b>fundraising campaign in order to collectively carry out our various actions</b> around reuse in the nautical sector.<br/>
        <b>Stay tuned to our news to find out the progress of the project!</b>
