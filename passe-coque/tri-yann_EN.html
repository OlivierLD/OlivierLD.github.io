        <h2>The boat</h2>
        Trimaran Allegro<br/>
        Tri Yann, the Allegro currently being refitted. Will be registered with the boat club.<br/>
        Boat designed by Andr&eacute; All&egrave;gre, architect of Pend Duick 4 built in S&egrave;te.<br/>
        Allegro obviously brings to mind a fast, joyful, lively and perky tempo... It is also a nod to its creator Andr&eacute; All&egrave;gre, who recently died. 
        This colossus, a true pioneer of the multihull, was nevertheless the architect of Pen Duick IV, renamed Manureva. A great man! Of course, the ambitious aluminum 
        trimaran disappeared with its skipper Alain Colas during the first Route du Rhum in 1978... 
        But before that, it completed a solo round-the-world trip around Cape Horn and won the OSTAR in 1972. The Allegro, launched in 1976, is also particularly innovative: 
        while the livework adopts very thin U-shaped hulls at the waterline, the central hull adopts an incredible step, further widened at the deck by the fairings which 
        cover the arms of connection. Underwater, the finesse of a multihull, inside and on deck, the volume and surface area of a monohull. 
        Certainly, modern trimarans also adopt this recipe. But still not as radically as Andr&eacute; All&egrave;gre imagined.

        <ul>
            <li>Reported length 8.35 m (but a small scoop was added by the previous owner).</li>
            <li>Largest exterior width 4.80 m.</li>
            <li>Gross tonnage 6.21 tons (this sailboat is exempt from the annual francization tax given its age).</li>
            <li>
                Approved unsinkable (report number 149-41/149-42) it was therefore exempt from survival in the old fourth category regulations contrary to what the
                Bateaux magazine states in its 1979 test prior to approval. This sailboat could be armed in third category.

            </li>
            <li>Foam volumes in the front and rear hull as well as in the floats.</li>
            <li>
                The connecting arms are integral with the floats and are bolted to the central hull using 8 bolts with a diameter of 18 on a 
                steel counterplate; the Allegro is therefore transportable! This is what the owner of Zorglub did with a 604. 
                Alphonse Rigaud dismantled the mast with a goat (read his testimony further) but it is far from being a cakewalk, even with a good team - and I never tried the 
                adventure! The weight given by the manufacturer is 1.3 tonnes...
            </li>
        </ul>
        The boat is called Tri Yann because its donor is called Yann and he is a musician (the friends on board) and friend of the eponymous group.<br/>
        It will be based in Saint&#8209;Philibert for the boat club and managed by the &Eacute;cole de Voile Oc&eacute;ane.
