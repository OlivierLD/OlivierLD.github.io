        The Cap Melvan project consisted of renovating a sailboat with the aim of crossing the Atlantic and carrying out a humanitarian mission in Brazil. 
        I therefore joined the Passe&#8209;Coque association, whose objective is precisely to connect boats in need of renovation and skippers who can take care 
        of them, with the aim of reviving boats still capable of taking to the sea. The association then gave me a Karate 33 that I named Melvan. 
        Melvan is the name of the Île aux Chevaux located between the islands of Houat and Hoëdic in the bay of Quiberon just facing Saint&#8209;Philibert.
        So I undertook the renovation of Melvan for a year in Toulon, before leaving for Brazil. We were two students on board, having taken a gap year to complete this journey. 
        Pascal studies at ENS Paris-Saclay while I am at SeaTech, an engineering school in Toulon. My uncle, Arnaud, joined the ship from Gibraltar to Brazil. 
        Leaving Toulon on October 10, 2022, we arrived at the Jacare marina in Brazil at the beginning of December, after passing through the Canaries and Cape Verde. 
        Once arrived we went to the village of Poranga, where our mission took place. We mainly carried out masonry work for a sanctuary in Poranga, as well as for a school 
        for people with disabilities in the town of Crateus. 
        We stayed 3 months in Brazil before leaving for Brittany, this time accompanied by Philippe, passing through Guyana, Grenada, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, 
        Martinique and the Azores.<br/>
        This trip will have been rich in discoveries, particularly through the landscapes and cultures that have marked our journey! For Melvan, this is only the 
        beginning of a new life and the sailings will continue, first to Toulon then to Brittany.
