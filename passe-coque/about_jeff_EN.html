        <h2>Jean-Fran&ccedil;ois ALLAIS</h2>
        Jean-Fran&ccedil;ois, aka Jeff, is a true jack-of-all-trades when it comes to the sea.<br/>
        From the fishing spots of his Normandy childhood to Breton surf spots, Jeff is as comfortable on a windsurf as on a kitesurf.<br/>
        His 10 years spent in a sailboat rental agency allowed him to explore the most beautiful sailing spots in the world.<br/>
        A skipper who loves the oceans, it is now locally and without a plane that Jeff devotes himself to his passion and shares 
        it with as many people as possible.
