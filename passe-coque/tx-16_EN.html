        <h3>Our story</h3>
        Sailing as an inspiring inclusive experience.<br/>
        Issé.O - The difference takes off - was born from the meeting between expertise and an ideal.<br/>
        The observation of the founders of the association is twofold: The social and professional inclusion of people with disabilities has never been so real. 
        And yet, many people remain distant from employment and society in general.<br/>
        But then, how can we change the outlook, both among able-bodied people and among people with disabilities themselves? How can we shake up representations 
        about their abilities?<br/>
        For the Issé.O team, passionate about sailing and rich in diverse skills in the fields of health, medico-social and public health, the answer 
        was obvious: “bringing it to life”, experimenting with inclusion.<br/>
        And for this, what better way than to be a member of a Hindi-able crew on a sailboat tossed by the swell and the breeze?<br/>
        We are convinced that inclusion should no longer be a subject in 2022 and that it is an opportunity for everyone.<br/>
        <h3>Our objective</h3>
        Promote the social and professional inclusion of people with disabilities through the practice of sailing.<br/>
        <h3>Our team</h3>
        A team of united, competent and activist enthusiasts who put their energy at the service of innovative iodized projects with a positive impact.<br/>
        <h3>Our values</h3>
        Sportiness - Solidarity - fairness - Eco-responsibility<br/>
        <h3>Our project: Sail together</h3>
        Propose to Norman institutions, associations and businesses a navigation and reflection program organized around inclusion along three axes:
        <ul>
            <li>Inspire: Bring inclusion to life through a sailing trip and the creation of a disabled - able-bodied crew. Feel the power of a different 
                collective and arouse emotion.</li>
            <li>Integrate: Value this unique browsing experience and understand the challenges of inclusion.</li>
            <li>Act: Create together an inclusive action plan for participating organizations and implement it.</li>
        </ul>
        Concurrently with this project, numerous awareness-raising actions will be carried out.
        <h3>Our boat!</h3>
        Thanks to the Passe&#8209;Coque association we have at our disposal a magnificent Selection&nbsp;37 from 1984 which will allow us to carry out our projects successfully.<br/>
        But before setting sail with the difference next summer, IMAGINE needs a makeover, and we need you! Help us finance the restoration of our sailboat and come sail with us!<br/>
