<h1>Where did I just land?</h1>
<div style="margin-top: 15px;">
    This page is a sort of home page for several aspects of my work.<br/>
    It includes links to articles, git repos, blogs, web pages, and other (isolated) resources.<br/>
    It can also be seen as some kind of playground, to illustrate what a web-UI can look like (without pretending to be the best one, by far).<br/>
    An interesting (in my books) thing to keep in mind: the Web-UI presented here contains <i>absolutely NO external library</i>. <b>No</b> JQuery, <b>no</b> AngularJS, <b>no</b> Underscore, etc.<br/>
    <i>I do not mean to look down on those frameworks, that would be really beyond stupid. I just want/mean to cut dependencies.</i><br/>

    It uses several <i>recent</i> specifications from the <a href="https://www.w3.org/" target="W3C">W3C</a>, about ES6, HTML5, CSS3, that might not be supported (yet?) by all browsers...

    You might be sceptical about the structure of the site..., and I am with you about that.
    It is a work in constant progress.

    This being said, enjoy the ride!
