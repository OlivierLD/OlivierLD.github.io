            Still anchored in Point Venus. Today, we are doing nothing, and enjoying it. We had some sleep to catch up
            on,
            the last night in Rangiroa was not as still as the previous ones, and the one we spent on the way shaked by
            the swell
            was not to be filed among the most relaxing we had so far. We caught up.
            <br/>
            From where we are, the island is very green, it does not look as dry as Taiohae was.
            We understood why, there are many showers; but that's very much OK, even refreshing.
            <br/>
            Yesterday, as it was Sunday I presume, there was quite some people gathered on the beach. They're back to
            work today,
            at last! :o)
            <br/>
            <br/>
            We'll have to go ashore some day..., the beer level is reaching an alarming low.

            Every night, with the sun cover over the cockpit and the hose fitted in it, we can collect a full jerry rug
            of rain water (ten liters).
            It usually goes directly in the shower.
            <br/>
            We went to the mooring in the Arue Lagoon (pronounce Aru&eacute;). We left the anchorage at Point Venus in
            the morning, after a squall,
            and 2&frac12; miles later (I know, it's a small leg, that is precisely why we chose the anchorage where we
            were), with the tide,
            we arrived in the Lagoon, with another squall. The secretary of the Yacht Club
            of Tahiti came to us, and assigned us a mooring. That was very nice from him, as the place was too crowded
            to
            anchor peacefully.
            <br/>
            We secured the mooring, and went ashore, we met the guy of the Yacht Club of Tahiti, very welcoming.
            <br/>
            They have showers, laundry, etc. And for two people, including the mooring, it is 900 XPF per day. I think
            we can afford it.
            <br/>
            There is a Carrefour (Supermarket) right across the street, Corine found some camembert,
            real ham, and all this kind of things...

            We discovered Pape'ete and the area after that. Well, it is a town..., with all its advantages and
            inconvenients.
            It is a one hour walk from the marina to downtown Pape'ete. We walked, and another time we took the truck
            (the bus).
            It's only 100 XPF per person ("C'est deux cents francs les deux", said the driver).
            <br/>
            I had some shopping to do, nautical charts. We went to Nauti Sport, they have a lot of things. I bought all
            the charts we'd need
            to sail around Tahiti. It's located in Fare Ute, one of the many industrial areas around the Port of
            Pape'ete,
            it's not very attractive.
            <br/>
            There are very few libraries and book stores in town, and the books are very expensive, at least twice the
            price we are
            used to in San Francisco, and the choice is quite limited.
            <br/>
            Magazines (including those that tell you that Margaret is now back with Michael) are at the same price as in
            France.
            Apparently, shit travels for free.
            <br/>
            It is definitely easier to buy a pearl necklace than a good book...
            <br/>
            <a href="PB200668.JPG" target="BigPic"><img border="0" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="right"

            We also found stores selling fabric, pareos and tapas..., we'll see what we can do with that.
            <br/>
            Pareos for Corine, and tapas for the couch in the boat's salon. The Read's will be on.
            <br/>
            About the Read's, I did some tune-up on the yankee. That went well. I was not quite sure the machine could
            handle it, the yankee is pretty
            thick on the edges. Well, it went OK. At some point, I was expecting this machine to die, so I could get the
            Z-Ultrafeed, but the Read's seems
            just to be unbreakable... Good!
            <br/>
            And we set the yankee back instead of the genoa. Almost everytime we used it, the genoa was half rolled
            up..., the yankee does a better job in that case.

            Then we were joined by Sky and his parents. After some time do get everyone used to the Polynesia time zone
            and rythm, we went
            for a sail, <a href="javascript:updatePic_12_19(0);">Sky's first sail</a>! On December the
            16<small><sup>th</sup></small>, we went back to Point Venus, which is sheltered and well protected from the
            swell, and from which we can leave at any time.
            And the next day, we set sail for Moorea. We went to the Opunohu Bay, on the North coast of Moorea. The bay
            is two nautical miles deep, we went first to
            <a href="GPX/plotter.html?latitude=-17.512123487742656&longitude=-149.85030877563986&scale=15&label=Robinson Cove"
               target="Maps">Robinson Cove</a>, close to the bottom of the bay, in the shade. But the shore was
            definitely too buggy for the crew - and Skip Sky - so we weighed the anchor
            and dropped it again in the Vaipeu anchorage, close to the entrance of the bay, just after the pass, in the
            East. This one looks a lot like
            what everyone pictures about Polynesia, white coral beaches, and crystal clear light blue waters... We do -
            again - see the anchor sitting on the bottom.
            <br/>
            Moorea looks like a mix of both the Marquesas and the Tuamotu. It's a volcanic island - it looks a bit like
            Ua Pou from the distance - and it does have a reef,
            and a lagoon, with all the fish you can expect. Snorkeling in there is just like watching a movie.

            Back from Moorea on December the 20<small><sup>th</sup></small>, against the wind - a steady 5 to 6 Beaufort
            - but not too much swell.
            We actually only had the sea of the wind, and that was enough for the majority of the crew... Little Sky was
            OK, though. We moored again in
            Arue, on a mooring of the Yacht Club de Tahiti.

            When securing the mooring, I noticed there was some slack in the bowsprit whisker-stays (mostly the
            starboard one).
            Investigating further, that was due to a <a href="javascript:updatePic_12_20(0);">big crack in the starboard
            whisker-stay chainplate</a>... The port one has a slight crack too.
            Both of them will have to be replaced...
            <br/>
            This has definitely happened during the last leg, between Moorea and Tahiti. Probably when we were pitching
            in those seas,
            a couple of time, the bowsprit was in the water, skewering the waves in the Moorea channel.
            <br/>
            Then we wait... We experience the polynesian way to do business. We went to <a
                href="http://www.technimarine.pf" target="TM">Techni Marine</a>,
            they can make the new chainplates, and they seem to know what they are talking about. We have to wait for
            the quote, and the job should be done
            shortly after that. The thing is that the guy in charge of the cutting machine is on vacation until Tuesday
            (Dec 28<small><sup>th</sup></small>), good for him.
            <br/>
            But let us not complain...,
            at this time of the year it would have been the same in many places in the world, and being stuck here is
            certainly not the worst.
            <br/>
            We're visiting Pape'ete and its vicinity...
            <br/>

            The weather in Arue - where we are - reminds us a bit of Oyster Point, it can be pretty windy. But this is
            the Trade Wind, and it is warm.
            It rains during the squalls, but that (usually) does not last very long.
            <br/>
            We took a chance to visit the peninsula of Taiarapu (a.k.a. Tahiti Iti), the plateau of Taravao. Pauline
            told us it looked like Normandy,
            that's right. I'd rather say Switzerland though, it's way more sloppy than Normandy.
            <br/>
            Anyhow, it's pretty nice... And just like in Napa Valley, it's always unusual to see cows grazing under palm
            trees...
            <br/>
            We drove all around the island, the North coast is bloody wild. There is some apparently sheltered places
            though, close to the
            Taravao isthmus (between Tahiti Nui and Tahiti Iti).

            <br/>
            They're now in place, we're good to go. Corine is finishing the supplies, we're cleaning up, the idea is to

            tomorrow. The weather is now gray and very rainy. We had squalls last night, which were said by local people
            (Laura &amp; Pauline) to be
            the toughest they had seen here...

            The forecast does not look good today..., it's anticipating heavy seas and strong winds (gusting up to 40
            knots) in our zone.
            <br/>
            This weather is generated by a low pressure in the South West, moving East-South-East. It should be gone
            soon, we'll wait.
            <br/>
            The picture on the left shows the same area as the one above with a rainbow, during a squall. The wind
            reached 35 knots in that one.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Anyhow, we are ready to go. We'll get another forecast tonight - if not earlier, and we'll see what we can

            The Yacht Club de Tahiti did not make us pay for the last day.
            <br/>
            We leave the lagoon of Arue using the west channel, it's <a
                href="GPX/LeafletGPX.html?track=exiting.arue.gpx.json&scale=16" target="Maps">pretty narrow</a>
            (25 meters
            at some point), but it's all right.
            We're targeting Moorea, before heading to Huahine.
            <br/>
            We still have a steady force 6, from the east; we're pretty much dead downwind. No significant swell,
            all is right.
            <script type="text/javascript">sailTag('Yankee, and two reefs in the main', 'div_01_01_11', YANKEE, NONE, TWO_REEF, NONE, NONE, NONE);</script>
            , we did it at 7 knots on average, fishtailing between the squalls.
            <br/>
            And there we are, anchored almost in the same spot as last time, it is still as nice as it was.

            So we are back again in Moorea, at the entrance of Opunohu Bay, just like last time with Sky, Brendan &amp;
            Chlo&eacute;.
            <br/>
            About last time, after she went snorkeling, Corine came back saying something like "I've seen some fish,
            with a prop". Everyone else went like "Of course my horse", and had a good laugh..., but she insisted "Yes
            it's true, it's definitely possible, why don't you guys believe me?". And everyone else went laughing
            louder.
            Well, there is a possible explanation, that seems to match.
            <br/>
            There are those big sea snails called "lambis" (local people call them "sept doigts" - "seven fingers") all
            over the lagoon in Moorea, they're pretty big,
            the shell is about one foot long, and half a foot wide.
            Some are covered with some kind of sea weed that grows in spirals...
            And when the lambis moves, it's using its foot (some kind of an ugly tongue),
            it's like hopping, leaving a track like a snail in the sand behind them.
            So, if you see such a shell, covered with spiral sea weeds, hopping like that,
            you can easily mistake it for some fish with a prop!
            <br/>
            Mystery solved!

        As it is both new year and the week-end, there is a lot of people on the beach where
        we used to hang out with Sky and his parents.
        <br/>
        There we can see the nice and so positive effects of civilization and globalization. Everywhere in the world, when people are gathered to have fun, they have to bring and turn on big loudspeakers that play the exact same kind of noisy shit <b>anywhere in the world</b>. Maybe not in Afghanistan, though (I'll check the cruising guides). The "music" relies on about two (some times three) notes, and can easily be generated by any cheap computer in a few clicks. It has to have as much bass as possible; when those boys have their balls bouncing in their pants, they feel like men. The lyrics are stupid (best case scenario, when they exist), but no one cares, it's (as it <b>has</b> to be) in English.
        <br/>
        What a pity, to have a chance to anchor in this paradise, and have to endure those kids
        trying to fight or manage their testosterone by being as noisy as possible (which means make more noise than the neighbor), as well as this imported crappy noise, to which they don't understand shit, but <b>that</b> is trending, as so many media tell you. Again, shit travels faster than culture or science..., nothing new under the sun.
        <br/>
        OK, I'm lucky among the luckiests..., at least I still have a chance to escape, and the right to go somewhere else. Nevertheless, I call it pollution.
        <br/>
        Those kids - playing that shit - are not to blame. Those who imported, introduced, and got paid for it are.

            <br/>
            The wind turns about North - that means we have to tack to exit the pass. Once outside, the wind slowly goes
            back where it belongs, east.
            But it remains quite strong, we have a steady 6 to 7 Beaufort for the first 6 hours of the leg. We're
            carrying
            <script type="text/javascript">sailTag('yankee, staysail, and two reefs if the main', 'div_06_01_11', YANKEE, STAYSAIL, TWO_REEF, NONE, NONE, NONE);</script>
            ,
            we are always sailing around eight knots - with even a spike at 8.6, that is too fast! We will arrive in the
            middle of the night, at that speed.
            <br/>
            So we dropped the main, only carrying the
            <script type="text/javascript">sailTag('yankee and staysail', 'div_06_01_11', YANKEE, STAYSAIL, NONE, NONE, NONE, NONE);</script>
            . But still doing about 7 knots at the beginning..., unbelievable!
            <br/>
            The wind is easing a bit after that, good for us. We'll spend the rest of the night between 3 and 6 knots.
            There is no moon, but we can see
            Huahine is the dark. We enter the Avamoa Pass at 6:20am, and we anchor in the North of the bay shortly after
            that, at 6:30am.
            <br/>
            Eventually, we did OK with the boat speed, this time we've not had to wait before entering the place.
            <br/>
            <div id="div_06_01_11"></div>
            <br/>
            The island feels "smaller" than what we've seen so far. The <i>town</i> of Fare is for sure smaller than Los
            Angeles...
            <br/>
            There are 9 other boats with us in the anchorage, though it does not have a good reputation (bad holding,
            gravel bottom).
            <br/>
            Well, this reputation is justified, within a couple of hours, we are dragging the anchor, let's move out of
            here.
            We're going south, facing the Point Ofaiorio, on the reef side. This one holds good, we went to check,
            snorkeling.
            <br/>
            It's a good thing, because in the lee of the mountain, it's quite gusting sometimes; above 35 knots during
            the night.
            <br/>
            We've restarted the little outboard engine for the dinghy. I had to clean the carburetor, but it is -
            surprisingly - still working
            all right.
            <br/>
            From this anchorage, there is &frac12; mile to go to the quay of Fare, and &frac34; of a mile to go to
            Xavier &amp; Falai's. It's feasible rowing
            (and we did it), but it is also all right with the engine! And with the squalls, it can be quite something.
            <br/>
            What would be a cruise, if we did not have to use the dinghies (specially at night, against a rain
            squall)?...
            And ours is not even inflatable.

            12<small><sup>th</sup></small>).
            The anchor is locked under a coral patch, that should hold. This time, we're only four boats, including us.

            We spent more than ten great days in Huahine. People we met took us to places that are not in the guides,
            maraes, motus..., they all
            gave us the best picture they could of their island. Thanks to Pierre &amp; Rautea, Jenny &amp; Peewee,
            Xavier &amp; Falai, Fr&eacute;d&eacute;rique, Pamela, Traore, and everyone around them!
            <br/>
            We leave for Taha'a on Tuesday, after refilling the water tank at the dock.
            <br/>
            The passage between Huahine and Taha'a is just a bit more than 20 miles, and it's downwind. It went nicely.
            <br/>
            We drop the anchor at about 4pm, just behind the motu north of the entrance of the Toahotu pass in Taha'a.
            It's yet another landscape
            here, the lagoon is wider, and shared with Raiatea.
            <br/>
            It's again a bit like of we had anchored in a post card...

            The next day, we sail around the north of the island, and we anchor again on the reef side, next to the
            Tautau motu,
            where there is a luxurious hotel, that seems to be empty for now. Some boats where here during the day, but
            they left in the evening.
            We have the anchorage for us alone... And we see the peaks of Bora-Bora over the motu.
            <br/>
            The first squall to hit us nicely waited for us to be safely anchored.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Apparently we are lucky with the weather, it should be raining way more than that. It's probably because of
            the Ni&ntilde;a we have this year.
            That would have been quite different with the Ni&ntilde;o we had last year.

            Another small leg, we go to the <a href="http://www.taravanayachtclub.com" target="TYC">Taravana Yacht
            Club</a>, at the south tip of Taha'a.
            For the occasion - as the weather was the right one for handicraft yesterday - we have a flag!
            <br/>
            We are on a mooring, the bottom is about 30 meters deep. The weather is still gray, because of the low
            pressure on the Samoa,
            recently upgraded to Tropical Storm, and named Wilma.
            <br/>
            A night at the mooring is 2000 XPF. Fee is waved is you use the bar. Our fee was waved.

            We need to do some supplies before leaving for Bora-Bora. On Richard's advice (Richard is <u>the</u>
            Taravana of the Taravana Yacht Club), we go
            to the Uturoa marina. It's public (and free), and there is a supermarket just across the street (we actually
            brought the cart
            on the dock, next to the boat).
            <br/>
            Piloting down there (Corine is now 100% OK with that) took us less than two hours, and the weather had
            cleared up, it was just fine. We had wind from the East, 4 Beaufort.
            We docked the boat almost down town (a pretty nice manoeuvre, docking the boat sideways, with no bow
            thruster..., very cool), and did all the
            needed supplies.
            <br/>
            The "Royal Princess" was here (yes, again), and as we are docked "downtown", we had a lot of visitors,
            spotting the "San Francisco" port
            of call on the boat, and coming to talk to us (some people came from... San Francisco)... Funny.

            Today, we go to Bora-Bora. We leave early - 08:30 am - from Uturoa, and head north for Taha'a, we'll exit
            through the Paipai pass. It's downwind at the beginning,
            and then some squall messed up everything. Some days ago, we were tacking to go south, and now we are
            tacking to go north.
            Go figure.
            <br/>
            The wind turns North, and even North-West, and drops... Fortunately, there is no swell (between 1 and 2
            meters forecasted).
            <br/>
            The wind picks back up around 3 pm, from the East, where it belongs. We are sailing along the reef of
            Bora-Bora, even with no swell, that is already quite something.
            Waves are crashing on the reef...
            <br/>
            We cross the Teavanui Pass at 4 pm, and go south in the lagoon, to anchor <a
                href="javascript:updatePic_01_25(0);">in the lee of the Toopua motu</a>. Crystal clear warm waters, as
            anticipated...
            <br/>
            It's a good holding bottom, fine coral sand.
            <br/>
            The next day, we change anchorage, we go to the bay Tehou, in front of that big hotel... That was a 0.6 mile
            cruise.

            We go south of Toopua island, and sail the bay of Povai bay up to the Bora-Bora Yacht Club, they have
            moorings over there;
            which is good, because the bottom is 150 feet deep.
            <br/>
            First night at the mooring is 2000 XPF, next ones 1000 XPF. One week is 5000 XPF.
            Fee is waved is you use the bar, but the bar is closed...
            <br/>
            We go for a walk "downtown" Vaitape, way more touristic than Taha'a... Moreover, two cruise ships are
            anchored in the
            Povai bay, with their payload of tourists, easy to spot.

            interesting.
