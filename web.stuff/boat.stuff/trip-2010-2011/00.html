            This is the tale of a trip in the Pacific ocean.
            <br/><br/>
            It took us from San Francisco in California to the Marquesas, then to the Tuamotu Archipelago, the Society
            Islands,
            Tongareva in the Cook Islands, Kiritimati in the Kiribati Republic, then Hawai'i, and back to San Francisco.
            (Check the Map in the navigation menu)
            <br/>
            It contains text, pictures, video clips, weather faxes, maps, all the kind of things you'd need to do
            it for yourself, in case you're planning to do something along the same lines.
            <br/>
            This kind of story has already been told many times, there is nothing really new or revolutionary in it.
            <br/>
            One of the goals - beside getting connected with friends and family - of those few web pages was to gather
            the documents we did not find on other web sites when we were preparing our trip.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            All images are (or should be) clickable, to enlarge them.
            <br/>
            When a picture has a
            <script type="text/javascript">stripTag('film strip', 'FS');</script>
            at the top and the bottom, it means that the frame contains several pictures,
            across which you can scroll by clicking the numbers at the bottom of the frame.
            <br/>
            <div id="FS"></div>
            <br/>
            The boat is a 42' ketch built in Honk-Kong in 1976, which has also been our home during the 6 years
            preceding the trip.
            Details about the boat can be found on the <a href="http://donpedro.lediouris.net" target="dp">boat's web
            site</a>.
            <br/>
            We were a crew of two for this trip.
