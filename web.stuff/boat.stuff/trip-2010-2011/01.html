            We left Oyster Point on October the 2<sup><small>nd</small></sup>, a Saturday, at 8:30 am,
            with the ebbing tide. The weather was what you can expect at that time of the year,
            gray and foggy. The wind picked up on the way, and we were sailing for real after the Bay Bridge.
            We came tacking close to the St Francis Yacht Club and Crissy Field, friends were
            gathered there, to wave us bye-bye...
            Janis and Michel took <a href="http://gallery.me.com/couvreux#100067" target="me">some pictures</a>...<br/>
            Outside the gate, that was a bit choppy, as we had the
            wind on the nose, and the current behind us. But that was all right. Cloudy sky, as expected.
            We had some porpoises around us.

            <br/>
            We had
            <script type="text/javascript">sailTag('all sails out', 'div_02_10_10', YANKEE, STAYSAIL, FULL, FULL);</script>
            , starboard tack.
            <br/>
            We were heading, but the wind was nicely shifting clockwise, and
            at 5pm, we were able to begin to ease the sheets, I was not expecting this to happen that early.
            <br/>
            At 6pm, a couple of whales (humpback whales) were jumping out of the water and hitting the surface
            with their tail and fins... Spectacular. One came close to the boat, blowing just next to Corine.
            <br/>
            At night, there was no moon, and the wake was all shining with plankton. Soon after that, some
            porpoises came to play in the plankton as well.
            <br/>
            To make sure she does not get sick, Corine had decided to sleep on the deck.
            She had her Afghan foulies on.

            <div id="div_02_10_10"></div>
            Unexpectedly, the sea is not too rough, the night is quiet. It's good for a start. And the weather is not
            cold.

            That was a fast night, always around 6.5 or 7 knots. The wind dropped a bit in the morning,
            West swell. Dropped the mizzen, pretty much useless at this point of sail.

            <br/>
            The wind picked up again at sunset and shifted left. Big long swell from West-North-West.
            <br/>
            At night, the sky was all clear except on the skyline, the Milky Way was like Las Vegas!

            Dropped the main at 1am, the wind shifted North and picked up, force 6. The wind from the North and the
            swell from the West, that generated quite a messy sea.
            The autopilot definitly feels better without the main in those conditions, and we're still doing a good 5 to
            6 knots,
            that's good enough for cruising!
            The boat can for sure stand the main, but we would have to drive, as the autopilot does not anticipate the
            waves.
            The boat would be doing a lot of fish-tailing if the pilot had to drive.
            <br/>
            The main came back up with two reefs at 7:30am, as the wind dropped.
            <br/>
            The forecasts (the faxes and GRIBs we can receive) said the wind should shift North-East and drop a bit,
            tomorrow or the day after tomorrow.
            <br/>
            Wind generator and solar panel did a good job today, there was no need to run the engine for the batteries.

            Very light night..., progressing slowly.
            <br/>
            It was like if the wind wanted to come back from North-East..., and then we had South wind!
            <br/>
            We were actually on the West side of a small high pressure - that's why we had this light weather - not
            mentioned on the faxes I had received. The barometer is going up too.
            <br/>
            Perkins puff..., there was no bloody wind. The good thing though, is that the swell was gone
            with the wind.
            <br/>
            But we did not break any distance record that day.

            There was some kind of a nasty choppy sea... Like two trains of waves, North-East plus South-East.
            <br/>
            One reef in the main at 8:45am. We've been at sea for now one week, we've done about 900 miles.
            <br/>
            In the afternoon, the South-West swell seemed to calm down, and that was not too bad!
            <br/>
            Corine was getting tanned on the deck.
            <br/>
            That night she got her hand burnt with boiling water... Ooch.
            <br/>
            She fixed it with the emergency kit, presented by Chantal &amp; Dr Do.

            We crossed the Tropic of Cancer around 5am. The weather is horrible, gray, cloudy. How tropical!

            <br/>
            We were in the ITCZ at 12:45pm, definitely! It's like a huge curtain of clouds and rain.
            The wind increased and decreased, shifted left and right..., all by the book!
            Puffs above 30 knots.
            <br/>
            A lot of birds around us.
            <br/>
            At 8pm, it seemed we were done with the ITCZ, that was faster than expected...

            , starboard tack, at 2pm.
            At 3pm, we were close to the Clark Bank. The wind was blowing from the North-East (I was expecting more like
            South-East).
            <br/>
            6:40pm: <b>Land Ho!</b> Corine saw it first. I did not believe it, but that was true,
            there was more than 30 miles of visibility. We were seeing Nuku-Hiva and Ua-Huka.
            <br/>
            Dolphins joined us for sunset. Very nice night after that.
            <br/>
            Sailing along the East coast Nuku-Hiva, that is quite wild. It was amazing to see that there was absolutely
            no light at all
            on the island. Absolutely none.

            waiting for the sun to show up.
            <br/>
            We entered the bay just after sunrise, and we dropped the anchor in about 40 feet of water.

            The Bay is the crater of an ancient volcano, collapsed into the sea.
