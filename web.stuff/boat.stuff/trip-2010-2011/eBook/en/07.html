                We leave Bora-Bora at 10:45 am.
				<br>
				Exiting the pass is not a problem, we carry full main, yankee and staysail.
				The wind is blowing from the East, about 4 Beaufort, as expected.
				We put one reef in the main shortly after exiting the pass, and that was the last time in several days
				that we touch the sheets... The autopilot is driving.
				<br>
				There is some swell, from the East as well (<b>not</b> as expected, but the opposite would have been a surprise).
				<br>
				The boat is doing nicely, between 5 and 6 knots. All is good.
				<br>
				<br>
                It goes like that during three days, nice days, clear nights, very few showers... That is the best opportunity we've had so far 
                to learn the stars of the southern hemisphere. 
				<br>
				<br>
				If it goes on, we might be able to make landfall by Monday.
                <br>
				The fourth day, the wind drops a bit... This is a slow day, we can forget about landfall.
				But that's all right, there is no rush. All sails are out, mizzen, full main, staysail and yankee.
				The pilot is driving all the time anyway, without complaining.
				<br>
				The wind comes back during the night after that,
				Monday morning at 1:30 am, from the North-East, as expected from the fax, showing an ondulation 
				in the streamlines.
				<br>
				We're closer to the wind, and the swell has dropped. At that point of sail, in that sea, the
				pilot consumes almost nothing, and the wind generator runs 24 hours a day, it's not blanketed
				by the mizzen, as it was when we were on that reach before.
				<br>
				Some rain squalls in the evening.

				We were again a bit early..., but only tacked twice before anchoring at 6:50 am south of the Taruia Pass, waiting
				for the tide to be right, and to check out the place before entering the lagoon.

				There was some swell at the anchorage, but nothing too big. The tide was flooding (thus against the wind), but that looked OK in the pass.
				We did it around 10 in the morning, and went south to the Omoka village, we dropped the anchor again, in Gudgeon Bay.
				Piloting has no more secrets for Corine. Even if - as it is here - the beacons on the chart are not always on the water...
				<br>
				The pass is narrow, and it's seriously breaking on the sides. Very impressive, even in calm weather.
