				  "<i>Don Pedro</i>" is the name of the boat...
				  <br>
			    <br>
		      This is the tale of a trip in the Pacific ocean.
				  <br>
					It took us from San Francisco in California to the Marquesas, then to the Tuamotu Archipelago, the Society Islands,
					Tongareva in the Cook Islands, Kiritimati in the Kiribati Republic, then Hawai'i, and back in San Francisco.
					<br>
					This kind of story has already been told many times, there is nothing really new or revolutionary in it.
					<br>
			    One of the goals - beside getting connected with friends and family - of those few pages was to gather
					the documents we did not find on other web sites when we were preparing our trip.
					<br>
					<br>
					The boat is a 42' ketch built in Honk-Kong in 1976, which has also been our home during the 6 years preceeding the trip.
					Details about the boat can be found on the <a href="http://donpedro.lediouris.net" target="dp">boat's web site</a>.
					<br>
					We were a crew of two for this trip.
