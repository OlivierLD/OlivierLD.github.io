				We leave Kiritimati after 10:30 am this morning, great weather, and the current is with us. There is some south in
				the wind, that allows us to get a bit to windward, just in case we have to come up a bit later on. We are trying to go to Hilo, 
				on the North-East coast of Big Island.
				<br>
				The faxes we received say we should touch the ITCZ tomorrow.
				<br>
				<br>
				Today was a very nice day, nice weather and great progression (about 160 miles in 24 hours).

                We're in! 
				<br>
				Today, we hit the bottom of the zone, it's gray, it's raining all day, but the wind direction is quite steady, and the
				force is not too strong, nothing expectional.
				<br>
				The fax shows a thin front, and the bulletins talk about a weak front. We should be out shortly.
				<br>
				There are two swells on top of each other, one from the North-East, the other from the South-East. That makes the sea a bit bumpy.
				<br>
				On our way down from San Francisco to the Marquesas, it took us twelve hours to get through, let's try to do the same...
				<br>
				The next night was not funny. The boat is shaking a lot with those swells, and there is not enough wind to go through them
				with enough power.
				But the fax we got tonight shows we are approaching the northern side of the front. That's good news.

                The wind begins to shift left, that could mean that we're approaching the northern side of the front..., but at 3:15 am, it
				blows from the South-East. That allows us to come up, but that also means that the front went north with us, as confirmed by the fax

				<br>
				It's raining non stop, but there is wind, at least.
				<br>
				This night, we are crossing - again - the ITCZ.

				The fax is showing the front behind us. Let it stay there!

				At some point, a school of dolphins - hundreds of them - is crossing our route, without paying attention to us.

                Nice weather today.
				<br>
				In the evening, the clew of the yankee blows up... We replace it with the genoa, rolled about 6 wraps.
				<br>
				Choppy seas, and the wind is heading.
				<br>
				Sea is really painful. If we head up as we could (and should), the boat stops. The wind is not strong enough to go through,
				we'd need more power.
				And the yankee would have done a better job than the rolled up genoa.
				<br>
				We carry the genoa, to get some power in the bow, and the full mizzen, to keep the bow upwind. 
				<br>
				But there is still that fucking surge on our nose, that is preventing us from making any good progresses. It does calm down from
				time to time, but it always comes back.

				We took one reef in the mizzen at midnight this morning, the wind is some times reaching force 7. Overcast sky. It calms down a bit with daylight,
				we set the main with two reefs, and dropped it again around 10 am, force 6 still, and that bloody sea...
				<br>
				The main is back up with its two reefs at noon, otherwise, we're just drifting. The boat is a bit overpowered, but that's the only
				way we can make progresses. Wind is shifting a bit after that, and we can sail the route. Good!
				<br>
				<br>
				At night, we can see both the Polaris and the Southern Cross.

				Still the same kind of weather, surge, squalls, etc. Still shaking a lot - which is probably the most painful - you <b>always</b> have to hang on to something not 
				to be thrown (or spitted) away...
				<br>
				This sea is probably generated by the trade wind blowing against the equatorial counter-current (blowing west to east)... 
				<br>
				Still trying to make headway, genoa (rolled about 6 wraps), two reefs in the main, one in the mizzen.
				<br>
				And the wind's heading. Overcast skies.

				Even like that, we're still falling to leeward... Ah shit!
				<br>
				The wind picks up, the sea remains as nasty as it was.
				<br><br>
				Short after 5 pm, we realized that we were cruising, and that this kind of sailing was in fact pissing off everyone.
				Too bad for Hilo (on Big Island), but we might as well go to Honolulu, in O'ahu. We did not even make 100 miles during the last 
				24 hours, it does not make sense to go on sailing this way.
				<br>
				We bear away, ease the sheets, and off we go!
				<br>
				The boat accelerates, and the rock'n roll stops immediately. Plus we now have some current with us.
				<br>
				We dropped the mizzen after 8 pm, for the autopilot to be more comfortable. Much much better!

				Squalls during the night, including some soft ones (with no wind).
				<br>
				After the ones we had before, the night is very pleasant. We have between 12 and 25 knots of wind.
				There still is this nasty surge from the North-East, but we don't care as much; at least, we're making headway.
				<br>
				Later, we'll begin to be sheltered by Big Island.
				<br>
				Short after noon, the line of the genoa furler breaks. Dropped the genoa, set the staysail.
				<br>
				In fact, the staysail does a very good job. We repair the furler's line, but the genoa remains rolled up.
				<br><br>
				At 3 pm, the wind drops, almost completely... We're indeed blanketed by Big Island this time, even if we are more that 15 miles in its lee. 
				At least, the weather is clear and nice.

				Wind comes back after 7 am, we unroll all the genoa, doing good progresses towards Honolulu.

				<br>
				But wait, it is not over yet... There are many boats outside, obviously waiting for something... In fact, there has been a tsunami alert,
				and all the boats have been sent out at sea, to wait for the alert to be lifted.
				<br>
				And we are waiting too.
				<br>
				At 2 pm, the situation is still the same... We drop the anchor close to the channel of Ala Wai Harbor. We'll spend the night here.
				The boat stops moving, it's all calm in there, at last!
				<br>
				<br>
				That's the first time - apart from the leg between Moorea and Huahine - we are not too early when finishing a leg..., we did not have to tack
				in front of the entrance, but we could not enter anywhere!
