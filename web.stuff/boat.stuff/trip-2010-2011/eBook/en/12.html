				After spending two nights anchored next to the entrance of Ala Wai Harbor, the Ke'ehi Lagoon re-opened.
				We went there, and we saw some whales on the way, big ones!
				<br>
				We anchored in the west of the water-skiing zone, it's very calm and very sheltered... How cool!
				We had the best night we ever had in quite some time!

				Yesterday was US Customs day, and today, Agriculture inspection. The officer was a very clean guy.
				He put gloves on to watch Corine cleaning the fridge. We are now "domestic".
				<br>
				We also checked with the harbormaster, the found us a dock. What a mess that was. I can't help comparing it to 
				the way it went in Tahiti...
				<br>
				In Tahiti (Yacht Club of Tahiti), the guy came to us in his Boston, and showed us what mooring to take.
				After securing the mooring, we went ashore to meet him. He said something like "Welcome to Tahiti, you can stay as long as you want,
				it's 900 XPF a day, you'll pay when you leave; here is a key for the showers". And that was it.
				<br>
				Here we came to the harbormaster, after anchoring in the outer part, to see if we could get a dinghy landing permit.
				They said we could not stay there, that was against the rules (which rules, they did not say, the Coast Pilot, Vol 7, says
				it <b>is</b> an anchorage). Then they had to inspect the boat. Fine. The harbormaster came for the inspection, and reproached 
				our bell with not having the right diameter (5' instead of the 8' legal diameter). That makes perfect sense when you know that the
				bell is a fog signal, and the number of foggy days per year can go up to zero in Hawai'i (the bad years, of course).
				<br>
				Then - after being certified (we promised we'll change the bell), the paperwork started. It took about half an hour... Between
				copies, photocopies, signatures, stamps, permits, authorizations...
				<br>
				I don't know how often we'll be inspected. But 95% of the other boats we can see in here and just wrecks or piles of junk
				(despite the harbormaster's effort to have everyone with the right bell).
				<br>
				Anyway! Now, we can come and go as we want. It just took five days...
				<br>
				We can also re-discover the land of freedom, with all its "Keep Out", "Restricted access", "Violators will be prosecuted",
				"Forbidden access", "Government Property, Keep Out"... We had forgotten about that, that feels weird...

				We went to see the sailmaker with the two damaged jibs today.
				<br>
				For the yankee, it's probably because the thread has been damaged by the UVs. For the staysail, well, it's probably because it's as old as the boat...
				We're waiting for a quote for a new one. Having a new staysail was in the air, somehow.
				<br><br>
				The harbormaster (who's definitely delicious) came to tell us that we could not use the lawn to fold the sail. We should probably have asked for a permit. Fuck it.

			    We've discovered a fuel leak under the diesel tank... Ah shit.
				We'll have to replace the tank.
				<br>
				Also, the battery charger - which we've not used since San Francisco - is dead.
				We got a small new one (10 Amps), which is doing a good job. Joe (one of our dock neighbors) lets us use 
				his power outlet, he's a nice guy (unlike some staff of the harbor...).

			    We got the new diesel tank today, it will fit. But removing the old one..., that is quite a project.
				Definitely too much work for the time we have here. 
				<br>
				After turning the problem every possible way, I think I will divert the tank of the heater to the engine.
				We will watch it, and use jerry rugs to carry enough fuel.
				<br>
				Now, I know what project to work on when we'll be back.

          Malaekahana Bay, north of Kane'ohe, probably one of the nicest of the island...			    
			    <br>
                There should be a way to find an anchorage on this coast, it's a very nice one. 
				That would be quite a change, after the gas tanks of Ke'ehi...
