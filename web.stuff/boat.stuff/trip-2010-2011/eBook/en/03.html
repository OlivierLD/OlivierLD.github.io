				<br>
				We've set the mizzen at 3:35pm. Even that downwind, it works, we go faster. And it's out of the way 
				of the solar panel.

			    All sails out, port tack at 1am. Everything's OK!
				<br>
				At noon, we set the kite, but it was a bit too sharp in the puffs..., it went back in its bag at 12:30pm.
				<br>
				The spinnaker sleeve is really cool, works very well.

			    We replaced the yankee with the genoa (and also replaced the jib sheets - new ones were waiting, the previous ones were a
				bit too short for the genoa).
				<br>
				With the spinnaker pole, it's pretty stable to go downwind.
				<br>
				Some gannet had been circling the boat, for quite some time during the past few days..., it decided to land on the solar panel
				to check out what kind of beast we actually were.
				<br>
				And of course, we had to clean-up after he was gone..., those guys poop as soon as they land somewhere.
				<br>
				The weather forecast is anticipating some thunderstorms for tonight...

			    This last night at sea has been quite something... Thunderstorms, thunderclaps, lightnings, the full show!
				And with the wind we had, we were going faster than any previous day of this leg. As a result, we were
				early, and we tacked a couple of times in front of the Tiputa Pass, waiting for daylight to enter it.
				<br>
				We got in at 5am, with the sun, the wind and the tide behind us, right by the book!
				<br>
				Some great dolphins are entering the pass with us.
				<br>
				With the current and the wind in the same direction, the pass was as flat as a lake.
				<br>
				We rounded the island visible from outside through the pass, the one with a single palm tree on it.
				We dropped the anchor in 40 feet of water. And we did see it on the bottom, the water is crystal clear.
				<br>
				All around, it's all blue and green... Blue for the water (all kinds of blues), and green for the palm trees...
				<br>
				Wow! I know, again...
				<br>
				The lagoon is so big that we could not see the other side of the atoll.
