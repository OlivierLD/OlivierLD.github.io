		        Nice night with no clouds. Clouds come back near sunrise, with a little bit of rain.
				A red footed bobby comes to visit us - and poop on the solar panel.
				We cross the Tropic at 6:15 pm.
				The wind drops to almost nothing after nightfall, during about one and half hour. It comes back after that, lifting a bit.

				Dropped the main at 3:20 am, the wind keeps increasing. Heavy rain.
                <br>
				At 6 am, the wind blows 8 Beaufort, we decide to drop the staysail (the brand new lovely one) to replace it with the storm staysail. That would be really too bad to explode it. Just after having droppped it, ready to set the storm one, we see that the boat behaves quite nicely bare poles; let us stay a bit like that!				
				<br>
				Lying ahull at 6:20 am, wind blowing
				from East-South-East, a steady 8, with gusts at 9 Beaufort.
				<br>
				This is not too bad, it is noisy but not as uncomfortable we would have imagined. Just after dropping the staysail,
				we cooked some pancakes. After that, we went to our bunks, to take some rest.
				<br>
				<br>
				The barometer begins to go back up again in the afternoon.
				<br>
				We put back en route at 2:45 pm, Staysail and two reefs in the main.

				Considering the way it goes, if we aim for the Bay, we would be quite late in there, entering the Gate at nigh, and probably too late for

				The wind picks up around noon, we put one reef in the main,
