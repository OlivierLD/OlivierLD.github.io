				Weather did not change, this is too bad, but we have to leave Omoka. The bottom is really holding very well,
				we did not move an inch backwards; and it was indeed pulling hard. But Gudgeon Bay being in the lee of the whole lagoon, there is way too much surge in there...
				<br class="calibre13"/>
				With a brief round trip ashore, we got the clearance from Taime. He gave us some bananas. Rowing against the wind in the dinghy, we broke an oar lock when leaving the beach, but we were able to scull back to the boat 
				(the moral is: you need to know how to scull), that was quite something. The dinghy was jumping and bouncing like a goat in a field. We left for good at 11 am, and we crossed the Taruia pass at 11:15, it was blowing between 5 and 6 Beaufort,
				from the East.
				<br class="calibre13"/>
				Very soon, we carry yankee, staysail and main with two reefs. 
				<br class="calibre13"/>
				There are two swells together, generating some nasty seas after leaving the shelter of the atoll. On top of that,
				we have some branch of the equatorial counter-current, against the wind.
				<br class="calibre13"/>
				The sea drops a bit in the evening.

                Again, like almost every time, we are early!
				As usual, we do a couple of tacks to wait for daylight.
				<br class="calibre13"/>
				Finally, we anchor with day light outside the lagoon, near the village of London. The trick is to find a sandy spot to drop the anchor.
				It seems to be well sheltered. That would be quite a change!
				<br class="calibre13"/>
				<br class="calibre13"/>
				It is interesting to notice that this time, the autopilot has been driving all the time.
				<br class="calibre13"/>
				The way we set the sails does not have the same goal as if we were racing. We are not trying to get every possible tenth of knot.
				The most important thing is to balance the
				boat, so the pilot draws as few energy as possible. The less it works the better.
				<br class="calibre13"/>
				This goes along very well with the comfort of the crew. We might loose half a knot in some cases, 
				but a well balanced and well driven boat is much more pleasant to sail, and much more comfortable.
				As a result, we really don't care if the trip takes longer...
