		        This island (which is an atoll) is also known as Penrhyn. Tongareva is its polynesian name, much nicer.
				<br class="calibre13"/>
				There are two "towns" on Tongareva. The capital - Omoka - has 250 people. Te Tautua - across the atoll - has 50 people. There
				are two ships a year for the supplies, from Rarotonga.
				<br class="calibre13"/>
				After anchoring in Gudgeon Bay, we had the visit of the officials.
				Andrew for the agriculture, Taime for the immigration. Those guys have time... They stayed quite some time on board,
				chatting, looking around, asking for drinks, etc... (We gave them a pastis, that cool them down a bit).
				<br class="calibre13"/>
				There is a $10 fee for the agriculture.
				<br class="calibre13"/>
				For the immigration, $50 fee for the officer's time, $55 per person on board, and $2.50 per day, as harbor fee (even if there 
				is no harbor, apparently).
				<br class="calibre13"/>
				The health officials were busy on the other side of the atoll, they are supposed to come next.
				<br class="calibre13"/>
				The health people - Robin and Tuku - came the next day. We offered them coffee.
				<br class="calibre13"/>
				There is a $20 fee, they sprayed the boat with some stuff. Apparently not too strong, there was still
				flies flying in the boat after the operation.
				<br class="calibre13"/>
				We were allowed to go ashore after that, which we did. 
				<br class="calibre13"/>
				There are kids all over the place, and people are very friendly.

			    The anchorage turned out to be pretty bumpy last night..., the wind picked up a bit (around 6 Beaufort), generating some short nasty waves, 
				and the boat was bouncing quite nicely... No way to sleep in the fore cabin.
				<br class="calibre13"/>
				This morning we are going ashore, to the BCI (Bank of the Cook Islands), to get some New Zealand dollars, to
				pay the various fees... They don't do that, normally. We'll have to come back tomorrow to see if anything can be done.
				<br class="calibre13"/>
				<br class="calibre13"/>
				During our short visit ashore yesterday, we met William and Jemaima in their house right on the lagoon. Jemaima was weaving lito 
				to make some fans with oyster shells (the mother-of-pearl part), very nice work. She asked Corine if she had some spare jewelry. They 
				gave us some bananas, directly from the regime.
				<br class="calibre13"/>
				Today, Corine made some crepes, and she had done a silver necklace with some of the beads she had brought on the boat. 
				She gave today the crepes and necklace to Jemaima, who had a kid smile on her face... In return, she gave Corine 
				one of the lito fans she was making yesterday.

			    We had a good night, not a rocky one as last night.
				<br class="calibre13"/>
				It's raining today, we will not go on the other side, we need the <b class="calibre34"><i class="calibre14">sun</i></b> above our head, to see the 
				coral patches, the zone in uncharted.
				<br class="calibre13"/>
			    We got the money at the bank... 1 NZD = 1 USD. Of course my horse!
				<br class="calibre13"/>
				Jemaima wants to know how to cook crepes.
				<br class="calibre13"/>
				<br class="calibre13"/>
				The anchorage is very uncomfortable here, we would be much better on the other side of the atoll, near the village of Te Tautua, but 
				as there is still no sun, and as it is head to wind, I don't feel like I want to take the risk to sail in this uncharted 
				area, with a boat drawing 5' 9". And the forecast does not sound encouraging..., the weather is likely to remain as it is.
				<br class="calibre13"/>
				With the waves, we're pitching quite a bit..., the hook on the anchor chain broke. We had a spare, we replaced it; but still.
				The windlass got damaged too, when fixing the hook. One of the pawls just got bended in a shock. Ooch.
				<br class="calibre13"/>
				If the weather does not clear up so we can cross the lagoon, we'll leave tomorrow. We cannot stay here, that's too much stress, on the boat, and on the crew.
