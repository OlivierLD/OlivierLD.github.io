	            The tide is low at 10:10am today, and that is the deadline for the passes. We will take the Avatoru Pass, as it is
				not right in the wind like in the Tiputa Pass. The sea might be easier to negotiate with the ebb, which we do need to get out.
				<br class="calibre13"/>
				Another good reason for choosing this pass is that we'll be able to sail it, engine would not be needed, just like on our way in.
				<br class="calibre13"/>
				We leave at 7:20am, there is a good East wind, as predicted. Short after that, we manage to put the anchor tripping line
				in the prop... Ah shit! So, we re-anchored, and I dove to clean up the mess. After pulling out the anchor, I was a bit short of
				breath, but we did it quite fast, we were smart enough not to put the engine in gear when we saw the tripping line was in the prop.
				<br class="calibre13"/>
				We left for good at 8:00am, sailing the lagoon with two reefs in the main, and six wraps in the genoa (yankee would have 
				probably done the job, better), to the Avatoru Pass that we crossed at 9:00am, the weather was nice, but that was already spectacular.
				I cannot imagine what it could look like in bad weather.
				<br class="calibre13"/>
				The seas smoothed down right after the pass. It's always amazing to see how the sea color goes to light turquoise blue
				to almost black as you leave the reef...
				<br class="calibre13"/>
				We are going around the North-West of the atoll. Some swell from the South-East is hitting us between Rangiroa and Tikehau,
				and it will keep doing so until we reach our destination. That's quite a pain. It's a very short swell, which is hard to 
				believe, the bottom is several thousands meters deep.
				<br class="calibre13"/>
				Some squalls during the night, rain and wind.
				<br class="calibre13"/>
				But the progression is excellent, we are always sailing around 7 knots, and right on the route.

	            Ah that swell! We could for sure live without it!
				<br class="calibre13"/>
				We are still progressing at a very good speed. We originally budgeted two nights at sea, but it seems that one will be enough 
				(indeed, so does the crew think: that <b class="calibre34">will</b> be enough).
				<br class="calibre13"/>
				The original target was Taina Marina, on the West coast of Tahiti, South of Pape'ete, but that one would be a little bit too far,
				as I am still reluctant to enter an unknown place at night, specially when planning to anchor.
				<br class="calibre13"/>
				The Arue Lagoon seems to be in reach, but I'm worried about the tide, that is just not right, max ebb when we're likely to
				arrive. Not good.
				<br class="calibre13"/>
				But there is an anchorage in the West of the Arue Pass, North of the Matavai Bay, in front of Mahina, right in the lee of the Point Venus, sheltered from the wind,
				and protected from the swell by a reef.
				<br class="calibre13"/>
				Well, that was the right choice, we dropped the anchor in this nice sheltered calm place at 3:15pm.
				<br class="calibre13"/>
				The boat is not rocking, unbelievable!
