		  Taiohae is a small place (even if it is called "big", by Marquesan standards), stretching along the coast at the North of the Bay. Everything we need is within a walking distance.
		  We're discovering the place, the Petit Quai, Moetai Marine, magasin Kamake, magasin Larsson... We're hiking around, to the Sentinelle de l'Est, and
		  to the Bay Colette.
		  <br class="calibre13"/>
		  There is an alignment to enter the Bay of Taiohae, two red lights. The surprising thing is that the two lights are not synchronized...
		  <br class="calibre13"/>
          The sea shore in the back of the bay is very nice and well maintained. There are some tiki sites facing the sea.
          <br class="calibre13"/>
          Every morning, people are raking the alleys to remove dead leaves which they burn in small fires; it's always very clean.
          <br class="calibre13"/>
          Marquesans all have a smile on their face, and they always return your greetings.

				<br class="calibre13"/>
		        Five miles west of Taiohae, there is the Bay of Hakatea (a.k.a. Daniel's Bay).
				It's small, but very well sheltered, it is in fact a bay within a bay (within Taioa Bay), behind a corner.
				<br class="calibre13"/>
				And when you round the last corner, you discover a white sandy beach, surrounded with palm trees...,
				much nicer than the nicest post card you can dream of! There was just one other boat anchored there when we arrived,
				a Rorqual (Azenon). They left the next morning, so we had the bay for us alone...
				<br class="calibre13"/>
				We went ashore with the dinghy, landing in Hakatea, and walking to Hakaui. There are many - really many - crabs 
				on the beach, trying to scare us away with their claws...
				<br class="calibre13"/>
				The village of Hakaui is pretty close to our dinghy landing.				
				There is no road to go the the village, just small paths. That's why to come here,
				you have to have a horse, or a boat.
				<br class="calibre13"/>
                There are many gardens in the valley, extremely well maintained, very clean. Grapefruits, mangoes,
                bananas, avocados, and all kind of flowers are growing there. People - Sidonie and her family and friends - presented us with grapefruits, bananas and
                avocados. The next day, Corine cooked some crepes for them.

			    From Hakaui, there is a trail to the Ahuei waterfall, which is supposed to be the second highest in the World.
				There are many ruins along the trail, old paepaes, sometimes with some tikis.
				<br class="calibre13"/>
				The weather has been dry lately, the waterfall was just like a small leak in the wall..., but the trail
				was nice. Nonos had a good time, biting the popa'as..., but that's OK. Corine brought the right repellent.
				<br class="calibre13"/>
				In the pool at the bottom of the waterfall, there was a huge eel, about five feet long...

			    We left Hakatea Bay this morning for Ua Pou, targeting Hakahau Bay in the North of the island.
				<br class="calibre13"/>
				That was an easy one, beam reaching at about 6 knots. Some swell from North-East begun to grow as we were approaching
				Hakahau Bay..., not good.
				<br class="calibre13"/>
				We dropped the anchor in Hakahau around 2pm, under a rain squall, next to a Tiki 38' we had seen in Taiohae,
				easy to recognize, as it is rigged the polynesian way. His name is <a href="http://alunaboat.wordpress.com/" target="Aluna" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1">Aluna</a>.
				<br class="calibre13"/>
				We were in fact too close to him, we anchored again - further - shortly after being set.
				<br class="calibre13"/>
				The weather was gray and rainy. Corine went ashore for the supplies, but I did not.
				<br class="calibre13"/>
				The night was a bit rock'n roll, as expected with this swell we saw when coming in.

				<br class="calibre13"/>
				The ride to Vaiehu went smoothly. Vaiehu Bay is spectacular..., the anchorage is still, but pretty small. And the waves on the cliffs around
				make the noise of the thunderstorm... Impressive, really.
				<br class="calibre13"/>
				<br class="calibre13"/>

				Just a couple of miles East of the Taiohae Bay, there is the "Baie du Contrôleur", itself divided in three bays,
				Hakapaa in the West, Hakahaa in the middle, and Hooumi in the East.
				<br class="calibre13"/>
				We chose to go to Hakahaa, with the village of Taipivai at its back, on the mouth a small river.
				<br class="calibre13"/>
				During the small leg between Taiohae and Hakahaa, we had some swell from the East (it always come from where we go...),
				not fun. But this is a small leg, we can deal with it.
				<br class="calibre13"/>
				When we arrived in the bay, Aluna was anchored close to the shore (he does not draw much with the centerboards up).
				<br class="calibre13"/>
				We anchored a bit further from the back of the bay, next to a nice very small beach of white sand.
				We will go ashore tomorrow.
				<br class="calibre13"/>
				There are some squalls of rain in the evening and during the night, the light is metallic, very special.
				The valley behind Taipivai is receiving a lot of rain during the squalls. And that makes great rainbows.

				This morning, there is a Land Rover next to the beach - we had not seen any road though - and some people
				are loading some bags, with sand and coral, apparently. They were having a break when we landed with the dinghy.
				Corine went to ask them if that was OK to land here, just in case. That's how we met Eugénie and her family.
				That was OK to land here. And we gave them a hand to load the truck with the sand bags they were collecting.
				<br class="calibre13"/>
				In return, Eugénie gave us a ride to the village of Taipivai. She explained Corine what seeds to use to make nice necklaces...
				<br class="calibre13"/>
				We messed around, the village is small, there are a lot of gardens growing vegetables, to be sold on the market 
				of Taiohae. We also went to the workshop of a sculptor (on bone and mother of pearl). Corine got herself a bracelet, made
				in dark seeds and shark vertebras.
				<br class="calibre13"/>
				On the way back, Eugénie gave us another ride, to the beach.

				<br class="calibre13"/>
				There is a pass, Teavaitapuhiva pass (490 m), which is the highest point of a road going from Taipivai to Hatiheu, on the North coast
				of Nuku-Hiva. It's not too long, but that is warm. The view from the pass does worth it, both coasts are visible, the North coast
				looks beautiful too.
				<br class="calibre13"/>
				On the way back, we were looking for a tiki site, mentioned in the guides. That was not easy to find - there is no indication,
				you must ask the people - but we made it. And again, it's something not to miss.
				<br class="calibre13"/>
				There are green pigeons in the woods.
				<br class="calibre13"/>
				<br class="calibre13"/>
				We set sails the next day. The sea near the Cape Martin was like a kettle, there was three different swells, all together.
				From North, from South, <b class="calibre34">and</b> from East. Never seen that before.
				<br class="calibre13"/>
				We originally thought of going to Hiva-Oa first, but there was no way to progress in this kind of seas, the crew
				was beginning to make quite a face... So we eased the sheets, and made it back to Taiohae.

				<br class="calibre13"/>
			    I was expecting the North coast of the island to be exposed to the North swell, but some people we met
				told us that Anaho Bay was in fact well sheltered. So we decided to check it out.
				<br class="calibre13"/>
				The multiple swells we had when coming back from Hakahaa is still there, what a mess.
				<br class="calibre13"/>
				That was much better when we reached the North-East cape of the island. The coast if full of bays, unsurveyed.
				<br class="calibre13"/>
				The anchorage we target is actually behind a point, inside Anaho Bay. We entered the bay, and then discovered the anchorage...
				behind the Point Mataohotu. There is no word to describe that. Sea turtles are swimming around the boat.
				<br class="calibre13"/>
				There is a coral reef close to the shore. And there is a small, narrow and shallow pass to go ashore, suitable for the dinghy.
				<br class="calibre13"/>
				We met some people, working on the palm trees (Gilles, and young people from the Island). They were actually cutting the old ones (so called dwarf palm trees..., at least seventy feet tall), and planting new ones.
				They are part of an association, preserving Anaho Bay. Like in Hakaui, there is no paved road to come here.
				Some would want one, but others like it the way it is. We're part of the later ones.

				<br class="calibre13"/>
				Again, there is absolutely no indication, ask the people, and they will see if they tell you or not!
				That's a neat way to keep assholes out of the way. They told us where to go.
				<br class="calibre13"/>
				The site has been restored by the people of Hatiheu, the work is impressive, we saw several tohuas (big gathering places),
				able to contain several thousands of people. There are also some huge - real huge - banian trees.
				<br class="calibre13"/>
				We had lunch "Chez Yvonne". Yvonne is also the mayor of Hatiheu, and she was part of the tohuas restoration project.
				We bought a book from her, describing the restoration process, with a lot of nice pictures.
				<br class="calibre13"/>
				For lunch, we had raw fish, and goat.
				<br class="calibre13"/>
				In the woods, we've also seen some "rupés" (Pacific pigeons). Those are birds, looking like pigeons, but larger (about 80 cm of wingspan).
				Their voice sounds between a crow and a horse. That's what we had been told, it seems quite goofy, but that's true.
				And they're very colorful.
				<br class="calibre13"/>
				<br class="calibre13"/>
				The next day, we headed back to Taiohae, through the same kind of nasty swells. We'll get ready to take off for the Tuamotu.
