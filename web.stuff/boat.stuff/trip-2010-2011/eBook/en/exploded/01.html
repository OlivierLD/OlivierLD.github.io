				We left Oyster Point on October the 2<sup class="calibre22"><small class="calibre23">nd</small></sup>, a Saturday, at 8:30 am,
				with the ebbing tide. The weather was what you can expect at that time of the year,
				gray and foggy. The wind picked up on the way, and we were sailing for real after the Bay Bridge.
				We came tacking close to the St Francis Yacht Club and Crissy Field, friends were 
				gathered there, to wave us bye-bye... 
				Janis and Michel took some pictures...<br class="calibre13"/>
        Outside the gate, that was a bit choppy, as we had the 
				wind on the nose, and the current behind us. But that was all right. Cloudy sky, as expected.
				We had some porpoises around us.

				<br class="calibre13"/>
				We had all sails out, starboard tack.
				<br class="calibre13"/>
				We were heading, but the wind was nicely shifting clockwise, and 
				at 5pm, we were able to begin to ease the sheets, I was not expecting this to happen that early.
				<br class="calibre13"/>
				At 6pm, a couple of whales (humpback whales) were jumping out of the water and hitting the surface
				with their tail and fins... Spectacular. One came close to the boat, blowing just next to Corine.
				<br class="calibre13"/>
				At night, there was no moon, and the wake was all shining with plankton. Soon after that, some
				porpoises came to play in the plankton as well.
				<br class="calibre13"/>
				To make sure she does not get sick, Corine had decided to sleep on the deck. 
				She had her Afghan foulies on. 
				<a href="pa190128.jpg" target="BigPic" class="pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"><img src="pa190128.jpg" title="Afghan foulies" hspace="10" vspace="5" alt="Afghan foulies" border="0" class="calibre31"/></a>
				Unexpectedly, the sea is not too rough, the night is quiet. It's good for a start. And the weather is not cold.
