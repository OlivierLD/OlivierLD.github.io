				We leave Kiritimati after 10:30 am this morning, great weather, and the current is with us. There is some south in
				the wind, that allows us to get a bit to windward, just in case we have to come up a bit later on. We are trying to go to Hilo, 
				on the North-East coast of Big Island.

				The faxes we received say we should touch the ITCZ tomorrow.

				Today was a very nice day, nice weather and great progression (about 160 miles in 24 hours).

				The fax shows a thin front, and the bulletins talk about a weak front. We should be out shortly.

				There are two swells on top of each other, one from the North-East, the other from the South-East. That makes the sea a bit bumpy.

				On our way down from San Francisco to the Marquesas, it took us twelve hours to get through, let's try to do the same...

				The next night was not funny. The boat is shaking a lot with those swells, and there is not enough wind to go through them

				But the fax we got tonight shows we are approaching the northern side of the front. That's good news.

                Nice weather today.
				<br class="calibre13"/>
				In the evening, the clew of the yankee blows up... We replace it with the genoa, rolled about 6 wraps.
				<br class="calibre13"/>
				Choppy seas, and the wind is heading.
				<br class="calibre13"/>
				Sea is really painful. If we head up as we could (and should), the boat stops. The wind is not strong enough to go through,
				we'd need more power.
				And the yankee would have done a better job than the rolled up genoa.
				<br class="calibre13"/>
				We carry the genoa, to get some power in the bow, and the full mizzen, to keep the bow upwind. 
				<br class="calibre13"/>
				But there is still that fucking surge on our nose, that is preventing us from making any good progresses. It does calm down from
				time to time, but it always comes back.

				We took one reef in the mizzen at midnight this morning, the wind is some times reaching force 7. Overcast sky. It calms down a bit with daylight,
				we set the main with two reefs, and dropped it again around 10 am, force 6 still, and that bloody sea...
				<br class="calibre13"/>
				The main is back up with its two reefs at noon, otherwise, we're just drifting. The boat is a bit overpowered, but that's the only
				way we can make progresses. Wind is shifting a bit after that, and we can sail the route. Good!
				<br class="calibre13"/>
				<br class="calibre13"/>
				At night, we can see both the Polaris and the Southern Cross.

				Still the same kind of weather, surge, squalls, etc. Still shaking a lot - which is probably the most painful - you <b class="calibre34">always</b> have to hang on to something not 
				to be thrown (or spitted) away...
				<br class="calibre13"/>
				This sea is probably generated by the trade wind blowing against the equatorial counter-current (blowing west to east)... 
				<br class="calibre13"/>
				Still trying to make headway, genoa (rolled about 6 wraps), two reefs in the main, one in the mizzen.
				<br class="calibre13"/>
				And the wind's heading. Overcast skies.

				24 hours, it does not make sense to go on sailing this way.
