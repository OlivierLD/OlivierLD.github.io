				Wind has been blowing all night, around 5 to 6 Beaufort. We leave at 6 am, to use the tide under the Gate.
				We're downwind, that's a nice ride.
				<br>
				Duxbury is behind us at 8:40, and we're entering the San Francisco channel at 9:50, that was fast.
				<br>
				We're at Bonita point at 11:05, and under the Gate at 11:30.
				<br>
				The Bay bridge follows, at 12:20, and we're heading to the south bay.
				The wind picks up, and we dock the boat at the Oyster Point guest dock at 2 pm, it's blowing around 35 knots.
				An interesting exercise, wind abeam, in the lee of the dock. 
				<br>
				<br>
				That's it, we've closed the loop.
				<br>
				<br>
				The next day, we went back to our dock, #5 end tie, the crew of the harbor had nicely prepared it for us.
