FLOUR TORTILLAS

125 g (4% 07) lard or butter, finely diced

600 g (4 cups) plain (all-purpose) flour
330 ml (11 fl oz) warm water

2 teaspoons fine sea salt
134 teaspoons baking powder

Sift the flour, salt and baking powder together into a large bowl.

Add the diced lard or butter and crumble it through the flour until the
mixture becomes sand like. Slowly add the water, little by little, while
kneading the mixture together until it forms an elastic dough.

Divide into 18 equal portions, roll into balls, then cover with a cloth and
leave to rest for 30-40 minutes.

Place a ball between two pieces of baking paper and use a rolling pin to
roll it out into a 22 cm (8% in) round tortilla. Continue rolling out all the
tortillas, then cover with a clean cloth until ready to cook.

Heat a large flat cast-iron pan or chargrill pan over medium-high heat.
Place Ã© tortilla on the ungreased pan and cook for 1-12 minutes on each
side, until the tortilla is slightly dry to the touch, with lightly browned
bubbles on the surface; it should feel dry, but still be soft and pliable.
While cooking the remaining tortillas, keep the cooked tortillas warm
by stacking them on top of each other and covering with a clean cloth.

Makes 18 x 22 cm (8% in) tortillas
